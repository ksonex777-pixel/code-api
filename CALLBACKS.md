# Callbacks

Players can use World Code in custom worlds get functions they've written to run when game events happen. These special functions are called callbacks. The world code can be viewed by pressing F8 by default. Initially the world code will have this comment, which can be removed:

```text
tick onClose onPlayerJoin onPlayerLeave onPlayerJump onRespawnRequest
playerCommand onPlayerChat onPlayerChangeBlock onPlayerDropItem
onPlayerPickedUpItem onPlayerSelectInventorySlot onBlockStand
onPlayerAttemptCraft onPlayerCraft onPlayerAttemptOpenChest
onPlayerOpenedChest onPlayerMoveItemOutOfInventory onPlayerMoveInvenItem
onPlayerMoveItemIntoIdxs onPlayerSwapInvenSlots onPlayerMoveInvenItemWithAmt
onPlayerAttemptAltAction onPlayerAltAction onPlayerClick
onClientOptionUpdated onMobSettingUpdated onInventoryUpdated onChestUpdated
onWorldChangeBlock onCreateBloxdMeshEntity onEntityCollision
onPlayerAttemptSpawnMob onWorldAttemptSpawnMob onPlayerSpawnMob
onWorldSpawnMob onWorldAttemptDespawnMob onMobDespawned onPlayerAttack
onPlayerDamagingOtherPlayer onPlayerDamagingMob onMobDamagingPlayer
onMobDamagingOtherMob onAttemptKillPlayer onPlayerKilledOtherPlayer
onMobKilledPlayer onPlayerKilledMob onMobKilledOtherMob onPlayerPotionEffect
onPlayerDamagingMeshEntity onPlayerBreakMeshEntity onPlayerUsedThrowable
onPlayerThrowableHitTerrain onTouchscreenActionButton onTaskClaimed
onChunkLoaded onPlayerRequestChunk onItemDropCreated
onPlayerStartChargingItem onPlayerFinishChargingItem doPeriodicSave

To use a callback, just assign a function to it in the world code!
tick = () => {}			 or			 function tick() {}
