# Client Options

A player's "Client Options" impact what they are capable of doing in the world. For example you can give them a double jump by setting the player's `airJumpCount` to `1`. Alternatively their health bar can be increased by setting their `maxHealth` to `200`. These API methods allow you to modify the client options:

```js
/**
 * Modify a client option at runtime and send to the client if it changed
 *
 * @param {PlayerId} playerId
 * @param {PassedOption} option - The name of the option
 * @param {ClientOptions[PassedOption]} value - The new value of the option
 * @returns {void}
 */
setClientOption(playerId, option, value)

/**
 * Returns the current value of a client option
 *
 * @param {PlayerId} playerId
 * @param {PassedOption} option
 * @returns {ClientOptions[PassedOption]}
 */
getClientOption(playerId, option)

/**
 * Modify client options at runtime
 *
 * @param {PlayerId} playerId
 * @param {Partial<ClientOptions>} optionsObj - An object which contains key value pairs of new settings. E.g {canChange: true, speedMultiplier: false}
 * @returns {void}
 */
setClientOptions(playerId, optionsObj)

/**
 * Sets a client option to its default value. This will be the value stored in your game's defaultClientOptions, otherwise Bloxd's default.
 *
 * @param {PlayerId} playerId
 * @param {ClientOption} option
 * @returns {void}
 */
setClientOptionToDefault(playerId, option)
```
